Challenge:
A suspicious .pcap file has been recovered from a compromised segment of the network. It contains a mixture of ARP replies and TCP messages.

Your task is to analyze the traffic, identify inconsistencies in the sources, and uncover the flag that was sent to a specific destination.

Look closely, only one source tells the truth.

Hint (Cost: 0 points)
Use wireshark to open the pcap file and search through the packets one by one until you find a packet that contains the flag in its body.

Solution:
run wireshark Spoof.pcap to see all pacekts
strings Spoof.pcap shows all strings
seed@seedvm2004:/mnt/hgfs/CNS-S5/CTF-26th-Aug$ wireshark Spoof.pcap
