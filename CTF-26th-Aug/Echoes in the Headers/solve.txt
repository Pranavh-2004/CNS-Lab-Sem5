Challenge:
The university recently rushed to deploy a new online portal called SecurePortal. It’s supposed to be “enterprise-grade” and locked down… but students are whispering that the developers cut some corners.

Rumor has it that one of the engineers left behind debugging breadcrumbs in production - little traces of information that were only meant for internal testing. The web page itself looks perfectly normal, almost boring.

But in computer security, what you see isn’t always the whole story. Sometimes, secrets hide in places that most users never bother to check.

Your task:

Investigate the SecurePortal homepage.

Look beyond the obvious content.

Find what the developers accidentally exposed and recover the hidden flag.

Solution:
Challenge asks us to run curl. Just running curl gives us the follows - "Welcome to SecurePortal!"
running curl with just headers gives us the flag
