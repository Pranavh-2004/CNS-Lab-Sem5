Challenge:
A covert beaconing tool has been captured transmitting data in chunks over UDP to port 31337.

The payload appears scrambled... until you realize the ordering depends on something else entirely.

Solution:
Just run wireshark on the pcap and check the last charecters of the payload and u can piece together the flag
