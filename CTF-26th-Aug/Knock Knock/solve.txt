Challenge:
A compromised system has several open ports between 1 and 100. One of them leads to a hidden backdoor service, but it won’t reveal the final flag unless you provide the correct passphrase.

Only one door unlocks the flag.

If you've completed the earlier challenge, you already possess the original key.

Otherwise, you may inspect an intercepted Telnet session from a misconfigured internal panel. The key was leaked over the network in plaintext due to a lack of encryption, a classic man-in-the-middle (MITM) weakness. This alternate key will also grant access, but only works for this challenge.

Hint (Cost: 0 points)
Use nmap to scan for open ports. Then use netcat (nc) to connect with the specific port and enter your pass key to obtain the flag.

Solution:
