Challenge:
User Credentials are buried in network traffic. Extract the plain-text username and password from a noisy PCAP, authenticate to the server, and hunt the flag.

Solution:
seed@seedvm2004:/mnt/hgfs/CNS-S5/CTF-18th-Sept$ strings cred.pcap 
This is a benign logging message. The system processed 512 entries. No action required; this is part of normal operation
. Please ignore.
Dear security team,
I was tracing some logs and noticed unusual activity in the access patterns last n
ight. The session details are strange 
 there are long headers and repeated GETs for resources that do not exist. Could 
you please verify the following account details when you get a moment?
Account summary:
  owner: Bruce Wayne
  username
: CNS
  account-type: admin

Hello, world!
seed@seedvm2004:/mnt/hgfs/CNS-S5/CTF-18th-Sept$ 

From this we get the credentials:
From the strings output of cred.pcap you’ve already uncovered the clear-text credentials hidden in the captured traffic:
	•	Username: CNS
	•	Password: CNS@PES

On using the given website we get:
seed@seedvm2004:/mnt/hgfs/CNS-S5/CTF-18th-Sept$ curl -s -D - -u 'CNS:CNS@PES' 'https://cns1-itsy-bitsy-spider.chals.io/protected' | sed -n '1,200p'

If we closely observe the X-CTF-Hint header we get a path /secret_route to check:

seed@seedvm2004:/mnt/hgfs/CNS-S5/CTF-18th-Sept$ curl -u 'CNS:CNS@PES' https://cns1-itsy-bitsy-spider.chals.io/secret_route
Nice work. The flag is here: aXNmY3J7VzF0aF9ncjNhdF9wMHczcl9jMG0zc19ncjM0dF9yZXNwMG5zMWJpbDF0eX0=

We then decode the base64:
echo 'aXNmY3J7VzF0aF9ncjNhdF9wMHczcl9jMG0zc19ncjM0dF9yZXNwMG5zMWJpbDF0eX0=' | base64 -d

This gives us the flag:
isfcr{W1th_gr3at_p0w3r_c0m3s_gr34t_resp0ns1bil1ty}
