> INTEL BRIEFING_
> We've detected a temporal anomaly originating from November 2, 1988—the day the Morris Worm was unleashed upon the early internet.
> The rival hacking group, "The Chronos Syndicate," has tampered with historical network logs from a university server that was one of the first to be infected.
> They've left a digital breadcrumb, a flag, hidden within the chaos of the worm's activity. Your mission is to analyze the provided network capture from that day and find the message they left behind.
> Something is... out of place. Find the anachronism.
